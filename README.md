# Truckr

## Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for Truckr, the platform designed to revolutionize the logistics industry by seamlessly connecting drivers and cargo providers. Our mission is to simplify the process of freight transport and management by providing a robust and user-friendly digital solution.

## Project Overview

Truckr's front end is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) leveraging the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) UI framework for a polished and responsive user experience.

This repository marks a significant milestone as we migrate from a monolithic Spring Webapp to a more scalable and maintainable architecture composed of a Spring API backend and a React SPA front end.
